# Quant 1a

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for weeks 08--10 of the
2025/26 BASc Quant 1a module.

*Note on content*: we will introduce Python across weeks 08 and 09,
making use of Jupyter notebooks to run Python; [read this introduction
for more information](./jupyter_intro.ipynb).

*Note on structure*: materials are organised by week, placed in a
 subfolder for that week; there is also a subfolder for any [process
 assessment(s)](./process-assessments).

Week 8 and 9 notebooks are based on the Google colab versions provided
with the core reading, [Think Python by Allen
Downey](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html).
