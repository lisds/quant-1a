# Quant 1a

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for weeks 08--10 of the
2024/25 BASc Quant 1a module.

*Note on content*: after an introduction to Python [week
08](./week-08), the module will use Python for descriptive statistics
[week 09](./week-09) then for inferential statistics [week
10](./week-10).

*Note on structure*: materials are organised by week, placed in a
 subfolder for that week; there is also a subfolder for any [process
 assessment(s)](./process-assessments).

Week 8 notebooks are based on the Google colab versions provided with
the core reading, [Think Python by Allen
Downey](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html).
